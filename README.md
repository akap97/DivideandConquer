# DivideandConquer

## problems based on divide and conquer

#### 1) ClosestPair: Given n points on a plane, find the smallest distance between a pair of two (different) points. Recall that the distance between points (x1, y1 ) and (x2 , y2 ) is equal to √︀(x1 − x2 )2 + (y1 − y2 )2 .

#### 2) TowerOfHanoi: Tower of Hanoi is a mathematical puzzle where we have three rods and n disks. The objective of the puzzle is to move the entire stack to another rod, obeying the following simple rules: 1) Only one disk can be moved at a time. 2) Each move consists of taking the upper disk from one of the stacks and placing it on top of another stack i.e. a disk can only be moved if it is the uppermost disk on a stack. 3) No disk may be placed on top of a smaller disk.
